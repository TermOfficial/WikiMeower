<h1>Mascot War</h1>

<!-- Page content -->
The <b>Mascot War</b> was a minor series of arguments about picking Meower's mascot that started on May 24, 2021 and lasted for a few hours.

<h2>Pre-Argument</h2>
MikeDEV <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/5266625/">made a post</a> about choosing Meower's next mascot (and background song) on May 22, 2021.<br><br>

The mascot choices originally included:
<ol>
	<li>a cat from Rhythm Heaven shared by @-CloudGate-</li>
	<li>a front-facing Scratch cat by @bloctans4 and @GuitarGuyPlayz</li>
	<li>a simplified Scratch Cat head by @MikeDEV</li>
	<li>a rounded orange cat head with diagonal ears by @trappist-1e.</li>
</ol>

Due to copyright issues, the selection was reduced to the mascots created by @bloctans4/@GuitarGuyPlayz and @trappist-1e.

<h2>Argument</h2>
The Mascot War was started with <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/5272558/">a post from GuitarGuyPlayz,</a> taking offense to @zedthehedgehog's criticism about @bloctans4/@GuitarGuyPlayz's mascot.<br><br>

@zedthehedgehog's post reads:
<blockquote>I mean... I do kind of have to agree with them. Mascot 1 <i>(@bloctans4)</i> looks... like how MikeDEV put it, it looks like something from Toon Town. The outlines don't look great, the head looks... weird...?? As for Mascot 2 <i>(@trappist-1e)</i>, it's just a cat head, that looks like a hamster, even with the ear change.<br><br>Please don't take offense to this.</blockquote>

After some <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/5272613/">"fundamental issues [not] being addressed"</a> with @bloctans4's second version of his mascot, people were <a href="//scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/5272648/">ready to get rid of the mascot altogether.</a><br><br>

MikeDEV ended the mascot vote on May 23, 2021 at 1:51:28 PM and chose @trappist-1e's mascot due to the previous argument. Many contributors considered leaving the Meower collaboration because of this Mascot War.
